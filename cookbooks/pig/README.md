# pig chef cookbook

Pig: a data analysis program for hadoop. It's like SQL but with less suck and more scalable.

* Cookbook source:   [http://github.com/infochimps-cookbooks/pig](http://github.com/infochimps-cookbooks/pig)
* Ironfan tools: [http://github.com/infochimps-labs/ironfan](http://github.com/infochimps-labs/ironfan)
* Homebase (shows cookbook in use): [http://github.com/infochimps-labs/ironfan-homebase](http://github.com/infochimps-labs/ironfan-homebase)

## Overview

This cookbook

* installs the package, from either the release (tarball available directly from the Apache Pig project) or the Cloudera apt repo.
* builds the piggybank of helper functions, if desired
* links to external jars and .confs (hbase, zookeeper, etc)

## Recipes 

* `default`                  - Base configuration for pig
* `install_from_package`     - Installs pig from the cloudera package -- verified compatible, but on a slow update schedule.
* `install_from_release`     - Install From the release tarball.
* `integration`              - Link in jars from hbase and zookeeper
* `piggybank`                - Compiles the Piggybank, a library of useful functions for pig

## Integration

Cookbook dependencies:

* java

## Attributes

* `[:pig][:home_dir]`                 - Location of pig code (default: "/usr/lib/pig")
* `[:pig][:release_url]`              - URL of pig release tarball (default: ":apache_mirror:/pig/pig-:version:/pig-:version:.tar.gz")
* `[:pig][:combine_splits]`           - tunable: combine small files to reduce the number of map tasks (default: "true")
  - Processing input (either user input or intermediate input) from multiple small files can be inefficient because a separate map has to be created for each file. Pig can now combined small files so that they are processed as a single map. combine_splits turns this on or off.
* `[:pig][:version]`                  -  (default: "0.9.2")
* `[:java][:java_home]`               - JAVA_HOME environment variable to set for compilation (default: "/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre")
  - JAVA_HOME environment variable to set for compilation. This should be the path to the 'jre' subdirectory of your Sun Java install (*not* OpenJDK).
