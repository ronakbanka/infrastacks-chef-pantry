#
# Science cluster!
#
# This is the hadoop cluster definition we use at infochimps for our science
# cluster. Storing the HDFS on persistent (EBS) volumes means we can stop the
# cluster at the end of the day (leaving the master node running) -- it only
# takes about ten minutes to bring the cluster back online.
#
# Using tasktrackers that are not datanodes means you can blow out the size of
# your cluster and not have to wait later for nodes to decommission. Obviously
# their jobs will run slower-than-optimal, but we'd rather have sub-optimal
# robots than sub-optimal data scientists.
#
# You will need the role definitions from
# [ironfan-homebase](https://github.com/infochimps-labs/ironfan-homebase)
# to use this cluster.
#
# To use this, please update the snapshot_id (and volume size) in the volume
# stanza at the end.
