# === Locations

# Zookeeper snapshots on a single persistent drive
volume_dirs('zookeeper.data') do
  type          :persistent
  selects       :single
  path          'zookeeper/data'
end

# Zookeeper transaction journal storage on a single scratch dir
volume_dirs('zookeeper.journal') do
  type          :local
  selects       :single
  path          'zookeeper/txlog'
end

standard_dirs('zookeeper.server') do
  directories   :data_dir, :journal_dir, :pid_dir
end

# === Install

# Here to clean up the old version that installed hadoop-zookeeper-server
kill_old_service('hadoop-zookeeper-server'){ pattern 'zookeeper' ; only_if{ File.exists?("/etc/init.d/hadoop-zookeeper-server") } }

# === Announce

# JMX should listen on the public interface
node.set[:zookeeper][:jmx_dash_addr] = public_ip_of(node)

# * zkid auto-assigment happens in server file only; clients don't deserve zkids.
# * preparation of zookeeper_host list happens in one place
# * Note to all: don't rely on the zkid assignment. Set it in the cluster definition

# Auto-assign zkid that is likely to be stable and predictable In
# practice: don't rely on this. Just set the zkid in your cluster
# definition before launch
if ((not node[:zookeeper][:zkid]) || (node[:zookeeper][:zkid].to_s != ''))
  # I apologize, future me and you, for what you see here. @mrflip
  #
  # So that node IDs are predictable, use the server's index (eg 'foo-bar-3' = zk id 3)
  # If zookeeper servers span facets, give each a well-sized offset in facet_role
  # (if 'bink' nodes have zkid_offset 10, 'foo-bink-7' would get zkid 17)
  #
  node.set[:zookeeper][:zkid]  = node[:facet_index] || node[:hostname].match(/[^\d]*0*(\d+)$/)[1]
  node.set[:zookeeper][:zkid] += node[:zookeeper][:zkid_offset].to_i if node[:zookeeper][:zkid_offset]
end

# Announcements

# TODO Elegently figure out when to announce election and leader ports as they are not always open.  

# NOTE: iron_cuke will not pick up the daemon as running due to username length > 8, len(zookeeper) = 9
