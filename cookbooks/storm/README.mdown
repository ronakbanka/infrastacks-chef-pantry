# Description

Storm is a distributed and fault-tolerant realtime computation library that supports stream processing, continuous computation, distributed RPC, and more.

# Requirements

* ZeroMQ 2.1.7 - Note that you should not install version 2.1.10, as that version has some serious bugs that can cause strange issues for a Storm cluster. In some rare cases, users have reported an "IllegalArgumentException" bubbling up from the ZeroMQ code when using 2.1.7 â€“ in these cases downgrading to 2.1.4 fixed the problem.
* JZMQ
* Java 6
* Python 2.6.6
* unzip
